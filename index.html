<h1>Welcome to Lim Wan Ling's home on the web!</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>Hi! I am Wan Ling, a 12 year old student from <a href="http://www.dunmanhigh.moe.edu.sg">Dunman High School</a>, Singapore.</p>
<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>I love dancing, singing, drawing, writing stories, having fun with my friends, winning, anything that interests me (rock climbing used to be one but I gave up) and anything else related to sports. I love doing anything that makes me active or artistic.</p>
<h2>Favourite Cartoons and Movies</h2>
  <p>My Main Favourites are How To Train Your Dragon, Miraculous Ladybug, RWBY and My Little Pony.</p>

  <h2>Favourite Food</h2>
  <p>I'm a really picky eater so I love anything that has cheese, ice cream, CHICKEN RICE, anything that has meat (this is the reason why I can never eat vegetables for a whole week).</p>
  <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
  <p>Throwing more than 2 parties in 2015, eating vegetables for all three meals for 3 whole days (was not pleasant for me but I did it since it was a dare), first time singing in front of my primary school friends (I used to have stage fright in front of everyone. Now, it's in front of people I don't know.) Running for 8mins and 15sec for NAPFA in 2016 (I was surprised).</p>
  <h2>Hates</h2>
  <p>People who stalk me (You know who you are!), my aleady obvious dislike for vegetables apart from some, being the last, losing, being defeated, when my Math and Science are really damn bad.</p>
