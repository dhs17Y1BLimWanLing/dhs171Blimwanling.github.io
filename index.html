  <h2>Favourite Food</h2>
  <p>I'm a really picky eater so I love anything that has cheese, ice cream, CHICKEN RICE, anything that has meat (this is the reason why I can never eat vegetables for a whole week).</p>
  <h2>Learning Journey</h2>
  <p>On Term 2 Week 9, the whole Year 1 level went for our learning journeys for our assignments.
