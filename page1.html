      <h1>This Is Amazing!</h1>
      <p>The museum was pretty big with amazing bones of three dinosaurs, different types of animals and plants. We didn't get to watch the light show for the three dinosaurs but most of us were able to buy souvenirs from the shop. We watched a few minutes of a video where people got rid of the flesh from a sperm whale after it was washed up on the shores of Singapore. There was a lot of oil and the Instructor said it was very smelly there.</p>
