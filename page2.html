      <p>We went to Chinatown to gather more information about the migrants in Singapore in the past. The teacher told us to take pictures as we would need them for our worksheets and our assignments so I took the most photos, which surprised my group members quite a bit. The worksheet the teacher gave us required us to eat some pastries at the local pastry shop there. My group leader, Edward, bought this brick-like, white, powdery pastry that Jing Yi and I decided not to eat. It looked hard but it's pretty easy to break it into half. We also went to the Chinatown Museum and learnt about the different migrants who came to Singapore for a better life.</p>
